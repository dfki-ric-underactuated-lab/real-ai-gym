<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Traditional robots today (such as the ones used in factories) have a
fixed base and are fully actuated under their operating conditions.
However, modern robots inspired by animals are not bound to one place
and are always under-actuated. Like animals, these robots can perform
dynamic movements, demonstrate compliance, and are robust to contact
during their movements. The interest in dynamic robot behaviors has
increased significantly due to the impressive athletic behaviors shown
by robots developed by <em>Boston Dynamics</em>, <em>MIT Mini
Cheetah</em>, <em>Agility Robotics</em> etc. This gives rise to the need
for canonical robotic hardware setups for studying underactuation and
comparing learning and control algorithms for their performance and
robustness. These hardware setups and the accompanying software should
be affordable, open and accessible. Similar to <em>OpenAIGym</em> and
<em>Stable Baselines</em> which provide simulated benchmarking
environments and baselines for Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms,
the concept of <strong>RealAIGym</strong> is introduced with a set of
reproducible robotic hardware platforms, for establishing a baseline for
the application of dynamic control algorithms on real hardware.</p>
<h2 id="gym-equipment">Gym Equipment</h2>
<p>The intention of the RealAIGym is to study dynamic control of
underactuated systems. On one hand, the studied systems should be simple
in order to be easily reproducible and accessible, whereas on the other
hand the complexity of the control problems they offer should be
non-trivial, so that qualitative and quantitative results can be
obtained by testing, comparing and benchmarking various control methods.
The current version of the RealAIGym accommodates five robotic systems
of varying Degrees of Freedom (DoF):</p>

<h3 id="simple-pendulum">Simple Pendulum <a
href="https://github.com/dfki-ric-underactuated-lab/torque_limited_simple_pendulum"><i class="fa fa-github" style="font-size:24px"></i></a></h3>
<p>A torque-limited simple pendulum is arguably the simplest
underactuated robotic system one could imagine. With only one motor, a
link and a weight it can be reproduced easily. A natural control problem
for the pendulum is to swing up from the hanging position to the upright
position and stabilize the pendulum there with a torque limitation.
Setting a torque limitation on the motor output makes it impossible to
directly swing up and instead the pendulum needs to built up energy by
first swinging back and forth.</p>
<h3 id="double-pendulum">Double Pendulum</h3>
<p>A double pendulum is a simple 2-DoF system with chaotic dynamics. The
system consists of two links and two motors at the joints. By disabling
one of the motors and using it as a passive joint, the system can be
operated either as an acrobot or as a pendubot system. Similar to the
simple pendulum case, a natural control problem is to swing up the
double pendulum from the hanging position to the upright position and
stabilize it there.</p>
<h3 id="hopping-leg">Hopping Leg</h3>
<p>The hopping leg is a 3-DoF system with two motors and one passive
vertical DoF. The leg is able to jump by pushing itself off from the
ground. Interesting control problems are maintaining a constant jumping
height and performing a backflip during the air phase.</p>
<h3 id="acromonk">Acromonk</h3>
<p>An acromonk consists of two links which are joined together by a
single motor. Two hooks at the external ends of both links facilitate
the acromonk to hold onto horizontal bars. As a free and wireless system
the acromonk is capable of performing brachiation behavior similar to
primates. The system is similar to an acrobot system from dynamics
perspective but provides an additional control challenge due to the
brachiation task.</p>
<h3 id="boomstick-hopper">Boomstick Hopper</h3>
<p>The boomstick hopper is similar to the hopping leg but instead of the
upright pole the hopper is attached to a boomstick which allows it to
hop along a circle.</p>
